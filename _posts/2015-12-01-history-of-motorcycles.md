The **history of the motorcycle **begins in the second half of the 19th century.[Motorcycles][0]are descended from the "[safety bicycle][1]," a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism to drive the rear wheel.[\[1\]][2]Despite some early landmarks in its development, motorcycles lack a rigid pedigree that can be traced back to a single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and inventors around Europe at around the same time.

## Early steam-powered cycles

Lucius Copeland 1894

In the 1860s [Pierre Michaux][3], a[blacksmith][4] in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' ("Michaux and company"), the first company to construct [bicycles][5] with [pedals][6] called a[velocipede][7] at the time, or "Michauline".The first steam powered motorcycle, the [Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede][8], can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest Michaux fitted a small steam engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.[\[3\]][9]

The design went to America when[Pierre Lallement][10], a Michaux employee who also claimed to have developed the prototype in 1863, filed for the first bicycle patent with the US patent office in 1866\.[\[4\]][11]In 1868 an American,[Sylvester H. Roper][12]of[Roxbury, Massachusetts][13]developed a twin-cylinder[steam velocipede][14], with a coal-fired boiler between the wheels. Roper's contribution to motorcycle development ended suddenly when he died demonstrating one of his machines in[Cambridge, Massachusetts][15]on June 1, 1896\.[\[3\]][9]

Also in 1868, a French engineer[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux][16]patented a similar steam powered single cylinder machine, the[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede][8], with an alcohol burner and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871\.[\[3\]][9]

In 1881,[Lucius Copeland][17]of[Phoenix, Arizona][18]designed a much smaller steam boiler which could drive the large rear wheel of an[American Star][19][high-wheeler][20] at 12 mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop Manufacturing Co. to produce the first successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).

## First commercial products

In the decade from the late 1880s, dozens of designs and machines emerged, particularly in Germany and England, and soon spread to America.[\[12\]][21]During this early period of motorcycle history, there were many manufacturers since bicycle makers were adapting their designs for the new [internal combustion engine][22].
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/fa863def-1aed-4d4b-90a5-7132336f7f09.png)

In 1894,[Hildebrand & Wolfmüller][23]became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a motorcycle ([German][24]:_Motorrad_).[\[10\]][25][\[11\]][26][\[13\]][27][\[14\]][28]However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built. The first instance of the term "motor cycle" also appears in English the same year in materials promoting machines developed by E.J. Pennington,[\[15\]][29]although Pennington's motorcycles never progress past the prototype stage.[\[16\]][30]

[Excelsior Motor Company][31], originally a bicycle manufacturing company based in[Coventry][32],[England][33], began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896, available for purchase by the public. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by[Charles Metz][34]in 1898 at his factory in[Waltham, Massachusetts][35].

In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of[bicycles][5]adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.

At the turn of the century the first major mass-production firms were set up.

In 1901 English quadricycle and bicycle maker[Royal Enfield][36]introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239 cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898, English bicycle maker[Triumph][37]decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902, the company had produced its first motorcycle---a bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later, it was the largest motorcycle manufacturer with an annual production of over 500 units. Other British firms were[Norton][38]and[Birmingham Small Arms Company][39]who began motorbike production in 1902 and 1910, respectively
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/d09347b7-0c82-4be8-83c2-1713a3225a23.jpg)

In 1901, the[Indian Motocycle Manufacturing Company][40], which had been founded by two former bicycle racers, designed the so-called "diamond framed" Indian Single, whose engine was built by the Aurora Firm in[Illinois][41]per Indian's specifications. The Single was made available in the deep blue. Indian's production was up to over 500 bikes by 1902, and would rise to 32,000, its best ever, in 1913\.[\[18\]][42][\[19\]][43]producing over 20,000 bikes per year.[\[20\]][44]The American company[Harley-Davidson][45]started producing motorcycles in 1903\.

During this period, experimentation and innovation were driven by the popular new sport of[motorcycle racing][46], with its powerful incentive to produce tough, fast, reliable machines. These enhancements quickly found their way to the public's machines.[\[12\]][21]

Chief[August Vollmer][47]of the[Berkeley, California][48][Police Department][49]is credited with organizing the first official[police motorcycle][50]patrol in the United States in 1911\.[\[21\]][51]By 1914, motorcycles were no longer just bicycles with engines; they had their own technologies, although many still maintained bicycle elements, like the seats and suspension.

## First World War

During the[First World War][52], motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with[despatch riders][53]on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. American company[Harley-Davidson][45]was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company[Triumph Motorcycles][54]sold more than 30,000 of its[Triumph Type H][55]model to[allied forces][56]during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499 cc air-cooled[four-stroke][57]single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.[\[22\]][58]

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".[\[23\]][59]Introduced in 1915 it had a 550cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph."[\[24\]][60]

## Postwar

By 1920,[Harley-Davidson][45]became the largest manufacturer,[\[25\]][61]with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.[\[26\]][62][\[27\]][63]By the late 1920s or early 1930s,[DKW][64]in Germany took over as the largest manufacturer.[\[28\]][65][\[29\]][66][\[30\]][67][BMW motorcycles][68]came on the scene in 1923 with a shaft drive and an[opposed-twin or "boxer"][69][engine enclosed with the transmission][70]in a single aluminum housing.

By 1931, Indian and Harley-Davidson were the only two American manufacturers producing commercial motorcycles.[\[31\]][71]This two-company rivalry in the United States remained until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle factory in[Springfield, Massachusetts][72]closed and[Royal Enfield][36]took over the Indian name.[\[32\]][73]

There were over 80 different makes of motorcycle available in Britain in the 1930s, from the familiar marques like[Norton][74], Triumph and[AJS][75]to the obscure, with names like New Gerrard, NUT, SOS, Chell and Whitwood,[\[33\]][76]about twice as many motorcycle makes competing in the world market during the early 21st century.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a00abcc4-0f49-4b4d-b8cc-a387bccd805e.jpg)

In 1937, Joe Petrali set a new[land speed record][77]of 136.183 mph (219.165 km/h) on a modified Harley-Davidson 61 cubic inch (1,000 cc) overhead valve-driven motorcycle.[\[31\]][71]The same day, Petrali also broke the speed record for 45 cubic inch (737 cc) engine motorcycles.

In Europe, production demands, driven by the buildup to World War II, included motorcycles for military use, and[BSA][78]supplied 126,000[BSA M20][79]motorcycles to the British armed forces, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1950\. Royal Enfield also produced motorcycles for the military, including a 125 cc lightweight motorcycle that could be dropped (in a parachute-fitted tube cage) from an aircraft.

### After World War II

After the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie, excitement, danger and speed of life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the US created a new social institution---the[motorcyclists][80]or "bikers"---which was later skewed by the "outlaw" persona[Marlon Brando][81]portrayed in the 1954 film_[The Wild One][82]_.[\[34\]][83]
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/a227205c-7c6f-4c8c-bba6-e499137e049b.JPG)

In Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with designing practical, economical transportation than the social aspects, or "biker" image.[\[34\]][83]Italian designer [Piaggio][84] introduced the[Vespa][85]in 1946, which experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/be8135fe-036c-480c-85c8-b199708f4431.JPG)

The[BSA Group][39] purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming "one in four".The German[NSU][86] was the largest manufacturer from 1955until 1959 when [Honda][87] became the largest manufacturer.

Honda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their[SOHC][88][inline-four engine][89][CB750][90]in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.\[_[citation needed][91]_\]It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the[KZ900][92].

[Suzuki][93],[Kawasaki][94]and the[Yamaha][95]each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.

### Japanese dominance
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98e58262-7ce5-4f90-9abd-14e68e06a3f3.JPG)

The excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned["slash-5"][96]series for model year 1970\.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the[East German][97]Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and[MZ][98]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when[Ernst Degner][99], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.

[Harley-Davidson][45]in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45°[engine vee-angle][100], which causes[excess vibration][101]as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.

A factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.[\[37\]][102]In 1980, BMW stimulated the "adventure touring" category of motorcycling with its[dual-sport][103]model, the[R80G/S][104]. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce[anti-lock-brakes (ABS)][105]on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.

## The present

Today the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although[Harley-Davidson][45]still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.

Recent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and[Ducati][106], and the emergence of[Victory][107]as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.

In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced that the first commercially available[diesel-powered motorcycle][108], its Track T-800CDI, achieved production status.[\[38\]][109]The Track T-800CDI uses an 800 cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. However, other manufacturers, including Royal Enfield, had been producing diesel-powered bikes since at least 1965\.

### In the developing world

There is a large demand for small, cheap motorcycles in the developing world, and many of the firms meeting that demand now also compete in mature markets, such as China's[Hongdou][110]which makes a version of Honda's venerable[CG125][111].[\[40\]][112]

Motorcycle taxis are commonplace in the developing world. Scooters, mopeds and motorcycles offer a fast, cheap and risky way around snarled traffic and scarce mass transit, as they can easily squeeze through jams.[\[41\]][113]

The first[ethanol][114][flex fuel][115]motorcycle in the world was launched to the Brazilian market by Honda in March 2009, the[CG 150 Titan Mix][116].[\[42\]][117][\[43\]][118][\[44\]][119]During the first eight months after its market launch the CG 150 Titan Mix had captured a 10.6%[market share][120], and ranking second in sales of new motorcycles in the Brazilian market in 2009\.[\[45\]][121]In September 2009, Honda launched a second flexible-fuel motorcycle,[\[46\]][122]and by December 2010 both Honda flexible-fuel motorcycles had reached cumulative production of 515,726 units, representing an 18.1% market share of the Brazilian new motorcycle sales in that year.[\[47\]][123][\[48\]][124]As of January 2011 there were four flex-fuel motorcycle models available in the market,[\[49\]][125]and production reached the one million milestone in June 2011\.
